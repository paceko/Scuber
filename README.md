# Scuber

Scuber is a new way to travel fast from point "A" to point "B" by scooter. This web app allows passenger's looking for ride-share to save time and make friends on short trips throughout San Francisco.  Passengers can book a scooter ride at the touch of a button and experience an enjoyable way of travel. 

Scuber allows for registration by both driver's and passenger's. On the driver side, a claimed ride will provide the driver with the prospective passenger's contact information. The driver can view his/her own ride history as well as the passenger's rating. 
On the passenger side, the passenger can enter a pick-up destination and a suggested route will populate. They also have access to their ride history and can rate their driver.
